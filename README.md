## Project Name: Car price prediction
#### Kaggle Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/hellbuoy/car-price-prediction


## General Description: 
For understanding pricing dynamics of the new market in the different cars for business growth, we will predict the carâ€™s prices depending on different independent variables. Several factors, including mileage, make, model, etc. can influence the actual worth of a car. From the perspective of a seller, it is also a dilemma to price a car appropriately. Based on existing data, the aim is to use machine learning algorithms to develop models for predicting car prices.

## Goals:

Predicting car prices on different things like car company, type of engine, auto risk or safe, horsepower, etc.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, this study explored various methods in
feature selection like Correlation Coefficient,LASSO Regularization and Linear regression with outliners detection methods, Descison tree, Random forest, SVM with different kernals aiming to predict price from a [car price prediction dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/hellbuoy/car-price-prediction) from kaggle.
